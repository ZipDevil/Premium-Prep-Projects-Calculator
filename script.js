// We are building up a string of operations to evaluate in the text input from the html:

// <input type="text" id="answer" />

// The idea here is to build up a string of operations from the different buttons of the calculator
// We'll do this with the addNumberOrOperationToInput function.

// Then we want to evaluate the string of operations using the evaluateValue function.
// evaluateValue should fire when the the button that displays the = sign is clicked

// add each key and operation to the text input
function addNumberOrOperationToInput(val) {
	// grab the element that has the id of answer and save it to a variable called answerField
	// increment the value property of answerField by the argument passed into addNumberOrOperationToInput
}

// clear functionality
function clearVals() {
	// grab the element that has the id of answer and save it to a variable called answerField
	// reassign the value property of answerField to an empty string
}

// evaulate functionality
function evaluateValue() {
	// grab the element that has the id of answer and save it to a variable called answerField
	// declare a variable answer set to the value property of answerField passed to the built-in
	// eval function as an argument
}
