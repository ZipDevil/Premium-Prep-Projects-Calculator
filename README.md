This repo houses projects for the end of SSP! We'll be diving into how a JavaScript file works with HTML and CSS file to create an interactive web application.

Learning Goals:

How functions can be used to update the DOM elements (HTML elements) displayed on the browser
How JavaScript can listen for user interaction events, like clicks, and update the page
How we can use the JavaScript eval function to evaluate javascript as a string. In our case, we'll use eval to evaluate math equations that is currently a string.
